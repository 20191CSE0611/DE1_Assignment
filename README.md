# Project : Airbnb Berlin Price Prediction

# Project Overview

Built a Linear Regression Model to predict the price for lodging or homestays at an Airbnb in Berlin.

</br>

# Tools and Libraries

The project uses the following Python libraries:

- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/)

To run and execute the Jupyter Notebook, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Anaconda Distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/).

As this project requires a couple of third-party packages that are not part of the Anaconda Distribution, it is most likely necessary to run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` before working with the notebook file.
